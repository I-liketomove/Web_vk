             <div class="question-text">Since ancient times, people have used fire in
               the household for cooking and heating their homes. Nowadays, fire is
               also used in many industries. Without fire, human life is impossible.
               But fire is creative only if safety rules are followed. Otherwise, a fire
               may occur. Especially dangerous are forest fires, which spread with
               great speed, and fires at industrial enterprises. Therefore, fire should
               be handled very carefully. If it is even more or less clear with gases
               (the gas burns, is oxidized by the gas + the required temperature),
               then plasma is a partially or fully ionized gas formed from neutral atoms
               (or molecules) and charged particles (ions and electrons).</div>

             <div class="question-text">The theory that all objects are made of atoms was
               first described by the Greek philosophers Democritus and Leucippus.
               But the modern scientific approach to the structure of matter was first
               developed by Thales of Miletus and his students. The Latin alphabet originated
               in ancient Greece, during the Phoenician colonization in the 8th century BC.
               Early works in the field of physics and engineering were written by Archimedes
               in the Greek colony in Sicily - Syracuse, as well as many other scientists.
               Mainland Greece is located on the Balkan Peninsula and is washed by the Mediterranean Sea,
               which flows into the Ionian Sea in the west and the Aegean Sea in the east.</div>

             <div class="question-text">Motivation is what gets you to a goal, what keeps you
               going when things get tough, the reason you get up early to exercise or work
               late to finish a project. More often than not, positive motivation works better â€”
               if you really want something, you'll do a much better job than if you're trying
               to avoid an undesirable scenario. Thus, motivation is the desire to achieve something.
               Sometimes you don't want to get up early and feel very sleepy, but if you have
               a reason to sincerely want to get up early, you jump out of bed with excitement.
               This type of motivation works best.</div>
